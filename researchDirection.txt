organizational methods




- Identify research questions
    Can learning examples be generated from professional websites?
    How can relationships between the DOM and JS be better visualized?
    What affordances can provide better understanding of runtime JS info?

- Identify target contributions



- Pilot study - inform the design

User problem
    Professional websites serve the pinnacle of examples: working maintained production code customized for its context
    Unravel's pilot study showed us that users copy and paste code from finished websites to recreate their functionality.
    The context of web tutorials doesn't clearly translate to teaching about customized examples on cool websites.
    Users desire to learn how to create functionality they encounter across the web, but inspection and reverse engineering is too overwhelming
    Unravel showed success in giving a starting point to users, but wasn't clear about the rest of the implementation
    Existing debugging inspection tools, and even unravel show either too much or too little of the picture

Research Questions (pre test 1)
    How can we extract JS/HTML/CSS examples from professional websites?
    How can we display information in extracted examples to aid learning for intermediate users?
    How do the extracted examples affect user understanding of a page compared to CDT or Unravel?
    Does Ibex alter an intermediate user's example-creation strategy for a professional website?

Ibex Proto 1 Design

    Design a proto that can extract source trace info from any public website (whether it requires auth or not)
        --> tutorial context problem
    Create a platform to highlight all code executed, showing more than just the starting point.
        Provide the whole JS/CSS/HTML context together for clear inspection
        --> inefficient copy paste all code problem
    Use platform agnostic techniques to cater to the expansive web
        --> user's desire to learn everywhere problem
    Provide reduction affordances to whittle away obvious library and dead code to help the user overcome entry barriers
        --> overcome too much / too little info barriers

    UX
        Henry:
            Installing tracer is odd workflow
            Interface takes a lot of explaining
            Why is code highlighted yellow after hiding inactive code?
            Even in the active code, there is still a lot to go through
            User didn't hide jQuery or holder.js, very distracting, hid them later


            "there's tens of thousands of lines of code, i'm not going to scroll through it all to find what i need"
            "i wish the JS wasn't obfuscated; in the html it's pretty simple to see functionality"
            "difficult to understand compressed uglification expressions"
                ternary
                !0 for true
                !1 for false
                void 0

            Not confident enough to delete lines of code
            "It's not really useful to show jquery at all, the common web developer doesn't care about library internals"
        Sarah:
            Started from HTML, wanted to see links between the two
            Hide inactive code is confusing, just show the relevant code
            We can't just a pull a component out and reuse it yet
        Kevin:
            A lot here that I'm not sure what it means
            None of the variable names mean anything
            Gives part of the picture (e.g. gets the item for something, manipulates the object some other way)
            Want to see actions attached to HTML
            Want to fold/hide functions I've already looked at
            Want to get to core of what the interaction is

    UI
        Henry:
            Identify what's modifying the DOM
            Identify where event handlers are registered
            Identify triggers from JS and from HTML

        Sarah:
            Keep it to a few hundred lines max
            The functions I care about were called way fewer times than util functions (may be more relevant)
            Want IDE functionality, as its hard to keep track of where I am
        Kevin:
    Goals
        A - identified responsible sources
        B - understand what's happening
        C - create an example

    I wish
        Henry:
            I could see links between the HTML and JS, want to begin from HTML because I understand it
            I could see calls populate live when I interact on the web page
            Library/Infrastructure code was hidden for me
            I could see what was going on when installing the tracing
        Sarah:
            I could bookmark interesting parts, mark relevance in the gutter
            I could see functions of interest related to HTML
            I could click on something and see all other references
            I could play with the code that alters the existing web page, delete and modify
            I could whittle this down to only the relevant bits
            I could trace the order of things happening
            I could see realtime routes through the code
        Kevin
            ditto

    Ideas
        Make ibex into remote debugging server

Ibex Proto 1 wins
    "I can finally see everything that happened, but I don't know what it means"

Ibex Proto 1 New Problems
    Users couldn't clearly find entry points to inspection (as in Unravel)
    The amount of active code is still overwhelming with internal library sources displayed
    The links between the DOM and JS were not clear
    CSS display is not helpful (maybe on animation styles should be displayed?)
        jquery toggle classes, JS modification of CSS attributes
        possible solution: tagging system, visualization linking effects through the output
    Output display is not helpful
        HTML --- JS
    Minification techniques cause confusion (e.g. void 0 or !0)
    Need more UI affordances to tell me what is most important
        folding to hide not important
        bookmarks to remember spots (e.g. ide overhead)
    Why does the rest of the page show up when all I care about is the carousel?
    Could we help the user know what variable names mean? (both obfuscated or defined)
        Variable evaluations over time (like debugging)
    Relating callcounts to handlers
    Could we work through the obfuscated variables to rename and define them?
        Variable name counts - as more clues

Research Questions (post test 1)
    How can we determine what source code was used during a UI behavior on a web page?
        Which extraction techniques help intermediate users overcome the limitations of minified code?
    How can we derive meaning from UI trace information while not introducing more barriers to learning?
        How can relationships between the DOM and JS be better visualized?
        What affordances aid an intermediate user's reverse engineering process for a pro site?

Design (post test 1)
    Interactive links between dom and js
    Bring back unravel entry points
    Default hide inactive and lib code
    Hide CSS & output for now
    Vote up/down sections of code
    Streamline tracing infra (auto trace and live feed as remote debugger)

    Better Unminification Strategy

Ibex in a nutshell
    Helps developers who know at least the basics of JS/HTML/CSS recreate the UI behaviors they see.
        Features that enable the above:
            Showing them the relevant JS behind the interaction
                Hiding unexecuted JS
                Unravel++
                    Difference: Unravel showed sortable list of code line pointers (hand off to chrome)
                    Ibex: Shows all the code in context, where you can inspect in the midst of all JS that was run, constrainable
                        all JS is imported and constrainable
                            Perhaps assume experts can/have identified library sections of minified bundle
                        Follow-up study: what do users want to see (then ignore everything else)
                Additional constraints to hide libraries / sub functions

            Show relevant HTML/CSS
                Constrain to only relevant (hide all the crap)
                Drawing lines

            Showing them how the JS manipulates the HTML
                Drawing lines between JS and HTML nodes

            (Punt) Giving them a sandbox to play and modify the page

            Giving them navigable playback through JS exec with hiding features

Evaluation: Not binary
    Don't prove the statement
    How did it work? (Time difference) (Feasibility) (Quality)
    Tradeoff between time/cost


Claims

Hypotheses

Contributions
    Conceptual
        Show intermediate users how pro websites use js/html/css to create an effect

        Other than recreating the UI event, what other learning can take place with this tool?


    System: "On professional web pages":
        Shows me how relevant JS and HTML interact on a page
            *possibly add CSS links
            how they're connected to the visual renderigns on the page
        Allows user playback and interact
            Records interaction, whats happening on all three code bases
            Scopes/filters output
            Outputs a new spin on a fiddle
        Showing
            What Theseus can do
                But on pro websites/ public
                Call counts
            Dom query counts and linked to HTML

        Study
            What do the affordances allow users to do?
                Recreate UI feature implementation in visible code
                    Quicker to recreate
                    Quicker to understand
                    Better understanding of how feature works

                Pre-Post ask-then-test study
                    Giving people opportunity to overcoming the barriers to learn from code
                        Study design?
                        3 examples found
                            Post survey
                                On a scale of 1-7 how difficult
                                How willing are you to do that on a web page you cared about?

                    Ask about some features user's would like to learn about?
